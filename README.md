## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I didn't use any outside sources]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[Before I started working on this project, I was nervous because I read that I will create a game, but I didn't think that I would be able to do it.
However, I knew that I wanted to try this out, no matter the fact that this was my first project related to applications. Moreover, it was my first time
being introduced to JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. After overcoming my fear, I read the first step and realized that there are guidlines and as long as I follow the instructions, I would be fine.
So I started reading all provided information and I would do what they told me, but it was challenging sometimes when I needed to edit the existing codes.
By watching the tutorials and reading the explanations of all used elements, I started doing well. In the final required part though, I did spend more time 
figuring out how to write the nested loop. I understood what is to be done, but I wasn't sure of the syntax. I decided to look at the given code and 
I ended up understanding what is needed. In this project, I realized that I need to be patient with myself because there are times things were confused and 
I tended to get angry, but giving it time and paying attention on details did help me.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[Seeing the final product, I was amazed by how codes collaborate to build something, like a game that people can have fun with.
It left me with curiosity of how these instructions were built. I am wondering how these codes are built and I would appreciate learning
about web development. Another question I have is whether web development requires using multiple languages at the same time like we did.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had more time to work on this project, I would override certain functions and add some features. One thing that interested me is the
idea of adding music sound, I would add a feature of lighting up multiple colors if someone loses and having a designed way of celebrating 
if someone wins the game. Moreover, I would do more rounds of differnt guesses that someone can play.]
